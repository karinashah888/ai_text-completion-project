# ai_text-completion-project
Understand how Generative AI processes input prompts to generate coherent and relevant text.  Set up and interact with a pre-trained AI model through an API.  Experiment with prompt design and model parameters to evaluate output quality.  Reflect on the capabilities and limitations of the AI model.

# Generative AI Text Completion App

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained Generative AI model via an API to generate text completions based on user prompts.

## Features
